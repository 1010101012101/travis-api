# Overview

**This documentation is for the v2 API. However, this endpoint does also serve the v1 API (undocumented).**

Welcome to the Travis API documentation. This is the API used by the official
[Travis CI](https://next.travis-ci.org) web interface, so everything the web
interface is able to do is also accomplishable via the API.

## Media Types

The API is currently [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) only.

## Clients and Libraries

Official, maintained by the Travis CI team:

* **[Travis Web](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web)**: Web interface and JavaScript library, using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/).

Unofficial:

* **[Travis Node.js](https://github.com/pwmckenna/node-travis-ci)**: Node.js Travis CI client.
