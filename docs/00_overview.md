# Overview

Welcome to the Travis API documentation. This is the API used by the official
[Travis CI](https://next.travis-ci.org) web interface, so everything the web
interface is able to do is also accomplishable via the API.

## Media Types

The API is currently [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) only.

## Clients and Libraries

* **[Travis Ember](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ember)**: The official Travis CI client, using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/).
